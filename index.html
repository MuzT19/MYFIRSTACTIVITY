    <h1>Buttermilk Pancake</h1>
    <h2>Enjoy the delicious taste of Buttermilk Pancake!</h2>
    <p>
        There's a reason buttermilk is so often used in pancakes. The acid in the
        buttermilk kickstarts the baking soda into action for extra height. It also helps to
        break down strands of gluten, leading to a fine and tender crumb. Additionally, it
        lends a subtle tang, exactly what we had in mind for our classic stack. There's just
        no way to get fluffy pancakes without it.

    <h2>Love Pancakes?</h2>
    <p>
        Fluffy, homemade Buttermilk Pancakes are the perfect breakfast. These pancakes
        are super soft and airy inside and with a beautifully buttery crisp edge. After
        trying this recipe, you won’t want the pre-made mix again. The best part is that
        they are so quick and easy to make (done in under 30 minutes).
        it’s literally stirring together wet ingredients and dry ingredients. It is hard to mess up. these
        puff up beautifully which means they go down easy. They feel light and satisfying.

    <h1>PROCEDURES</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, add the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda, and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk the buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the buttermilk mixture to the dry ingredients, gently incorporating with a spatula. Make sure
            not to overmix, as that will
            result in dense pancakes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter to a pan over medium low heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, add 1/2 cup (80mL)
            of batter to the pan.</li>
        <li>Cook until the top side begins to bubble and the bottom is golden brown. Flip the pancake and cook
            until the underside is golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
    </ol>
